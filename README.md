#  Kotlin Coroutines Workshop

This workshop is meant to help you getting started with kotIin coroutines and their use in both a standalone environment, and within an Android app.

In order to get to the end of the codelab, we will need a couple of things:

 - a valid GitHub token  (which can be  generated **[here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)**)
 - IntelliJ Idea and/or Android Studio

## Links

We will base this codelab upon sections of already available resources from Google and JetBrains:

 - JetBrains Coroutines and Flow codelab ([link](https://play.kotlinlang.org/hands-on/Introduction%20to%20Coroutines%20and%20Channels/01_Introduction)) 
 - Android and Coroutines Codelab ([link](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/kotlin-coroutines/index.html?index=../..index#0))

## Additional resources

In case you want to play more with Coroutines, you can check these other codelabs:

 - Coroutines with Room ([link](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/kotlin-android-training-coroutines-and-room/#0))
